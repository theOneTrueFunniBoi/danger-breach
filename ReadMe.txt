***********************************************************************************

		                ---SCP - DB Stuff---

There are a couple new rooms, code tweaks, a new engine, subtitles, and lots of new sfx and gfx.

Play the intro sequence for an achievement.

Don't Spam the elevator buttons or something funny happens.

The 3D Menu doesn't play nice with Anti-aliased text so AA gets disabled if you're using the 3D Menu and vise versa.

The game saves options and save data to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\DangerBreach.

Please send all errors to "funniman.exe" on discord, or the game's GitHub.
