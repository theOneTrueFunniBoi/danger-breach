There are a couple new rooms, and some minor source code tweaks.
Most changes are rooms, sfx, or gfx

Play the intro sequence for an achievement.

Don't Spam the elevator buttons or something funny happens.

The 3D Menu doesn't play nice with Anti-aliased text so AA gets disabled if you're using the 3D Menu and vise versa.

Borderless windowed mode is fucked so i disabled it.

The game saves options and save data to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\DangerBreach.
