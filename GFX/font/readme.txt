The way this is set up is to work around a bug in Blitz3D,
where it will not load a font if the filename and display names
don't match. To actually fix the bug, the engine needs to be modified.

NOTE FROM SCP-DB DEV: Despite knowing that this bug existed, the Courier New Bold font was mistakenly named Courier New, causing this bug to occur.
I've fixed it in SCP-DB but just figured yall should know.
